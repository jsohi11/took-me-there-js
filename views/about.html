<h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
<p>This project was created 

<h1>BUILDING</h1>

<h1>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h1>
<p>Thank you to the amazing instructional team (Kisha, David, and Nicole for back-end; Avand, Sandy, and Courtney for front-end) at General Assembly San Francisco for teaching me the foundations of web development and being both motivators and a support resource. And of course, our Producer Mercedes who has encouraged me to keep learning.</p>
<p>In addition to the GA crew, my friend-tutors were instrumental in helping me learn and think through debugging--especially, thanks to SB for spending part of 4th of July teaching me the Uber API and RW for taking a weekend to teach me node.js.</p>
<p>Finally, thanks to IA for the original concept of an Uber passport back when we were in 405.</p>
